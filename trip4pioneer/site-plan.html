        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This website is designed to describe the places (and their history) of our family's summer trip to the U.S. This trip is special to us because we will visit many historical sites of early Church history, like Palmyra, Harmony, Nauvoo, and Salt Lake City.  I hope this website will motivate others to learn more about Church history and travel the pioneer trail to experience the joy and challenges of our early members. </p> <!-- change this -->

            We'll also be visiting Joseph Smith's Birthplace, Historic Kirtland, Historic Nauvoo, Carthage Jail, and the Mormon Trail Center at Historic Winter Quarters, where we'll get to learn more about the history and legacy of the Church.
            And of course, no trip to the Church's Historic Sites would be complete without a visit to the iconic Salt Lake Temple, the spiritual heart of the Church.
