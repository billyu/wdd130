                    <h3>Day 1: New York to Harmony to Rochester</h3>
                    <p>
                        We'll start our trip early in the morning and drive from New York to Harmony, Pennsylvania,
                        which is approximately 5 hours away. Harmony is an important site for LDS history, as it is
                        where Joseph Smith and his wife Emma lived when they first began translating the Book of Mormon.
                        We can visit the Susquehanna River, where Joseph Smith received many of his early revelations,
                        and where he first met Oliver Cowdery. We can also visit the Isaac Hale Home and the Priesthood
                        Restoration Site. After exploring Harmony, we'll drive to Rochester, New York, which is
                        approximately 2 hours away. In Rochester, we can rest for the night before starting our
                        exploration of other LDS historic sites in the area.

                        an hour away from Rochester. Palmyra is the birthplace of the LDS church and is home to many
                        important historic sites, including the Sacred Grove where Joseph Smith had his first vision,
                        the Hill Cumorah where he received the golden plates, and the Palmyra Temple. Spend the morning
                        visiting these historic sites before heading to Fayette, New York, which is about 30 minutes
                        away. In Fayette, we can visit the Peter Whitmer Farm, which is where the Church of Jesus Christ
                        of Latter-day Saints was officially organized on April 6, 1830. After a full day of exploring,
                        we'll return to Rochester to rest for the night.

                        hours away from Rochester. Niagara Falls is one of the most spectacular natural wonders in the
                        world and is a must-see for anyone visiting the area. Spend the day exploring the falls and its

                        century and is home to many historic sites, including the Kirtland Temple, the John Johnson
                        Farm, and the Newel K. Whitney Store. Spend the afternoon exploring these historic sites before
