                    <h3>Day 1: New York to Harmony to Rochester</h3>
                    <p>
                        We'll start our trip early in the morning and drive from New York to Harmony, Pennsylvania,
                        which is approximately 5 hours away. Harmony is an important site for LDS history, as it is
                        where Joseph Smith and his wife Emma lived when they first began translating the Book of Mormon.
                        We can visit the Susquehanna River, where Joseph Smith received many of his early revelations,
                        and where he first met Oliver Cowdery. We can also visit the Isaac Hale Home and the Priesthood
                        Restoration Site. After exploring Harmony, we'll drive to Rochester, New York, which is
                        approximately 2 hours away. In Rochester, we can rest for the night before starting our
                        exploration of other LDS historic sites in the area.

                        an hour away from Rochester. Palmyra is the birthplace of the LDS church and is home to many
                        important historic sites, including the Sacred Grove where Joseph Smith had his first vision,
                        the Hill Cumorah where he received the golden plates, and the Palmyra Temple. Spend the morning

                        away. In Fayette, we can visit the Peter Whitmer Farm, which is where the Church of Jesus Christ
                        of Latter-day Saints was officially organized on April 6, 1830. After a full day of exploring,

                        century and is home to many historic sites, including the Kirtland Temple, the John Johnson
