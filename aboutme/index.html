    <p>Hi, Nihao! Let me briefly introduce myself. I am a father of four lovely children.
       I am from Hsinchu, the Silicon Valley of Taiwan. It is where the TSMC is located. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for more than thirty years. 
       I currently serve as the second counselor of the Elders Quorum of Hsinchu 1st Ward. 
       I love the church and its people who are good disciples of Jesus Christ. </p>
    <p>I love programming, so I started a software company about fifteen years ago. 
       But unfortunately, since then, I have not had opportunities to write code! 
       I had to do all the management work. Until recently, the BYU Pathway program 
       had given me a great chance to relearn my computer skill. 
       I believe it will be an incredible journey!
    <p>I am excited to get to know all my classmates and learn together!</p>
